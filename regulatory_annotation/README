# Calculate PWM scores for candidate transcription factors along scaffold 2503,
# and identify candidates that are in the tail of the black lemur distribution,
# where the blue-eyed black lemur allele has a lower PWM score,
# where the blue-eyed black lemur allele is derived,
# and that are within a certain distance of high-scoring PWMs for another TF.
1) Use CalculatePWMScores.py (separately for each TF) to get PWM scores for all positions across the scaffold.
2) Use TailOfPWMScores.R to identify sites with high binding scores in black lemur.
3) Use TFBSCandidates.py (separately for each TF) to get a list of candidates in the tail with a lower score in blue-eyed.
4) Use PolarizeTFBSCandidates.py to classify sites from the candidate list according to which species has the derived allele.
5) Use AdjacentToOtherTFBS.R to determine which of the candidates for which the blue-eyed allele is derived are within a certain distance of potential binding sites for another TF.
